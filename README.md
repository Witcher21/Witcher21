### 🚀 The Value I Bring
Coming from a background in **Wealth Management**, I don't just write code; I architect systems that solve real business problems. I understand data structures, financial logic, and user experience from both a technical and a business perspective. I build applications that are scalable, secure, and user-centric.

**🟢 Currently Open For:** Full-time Software Engineering roles, Contract work, and Freelance projects.
